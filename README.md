# Natours Application

This website was built using course "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023" made by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. On my own I added to it: middleware to make sure user booked a tour before leaving a review, nested booking routes, signup page, forgot password and reset password pages, review form that shows up if user booked a tour and didn't left a review for it yet.
